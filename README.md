Project created using Python, Qt Designer and PySide6.
I hope it helps everyone who is starting now in the Python world.
This project works very well with Windows, however on Linux and macOS there are some font size problems and the custom title bar does not work very well.

# REQUERIMENTS:
> ```sh
> pip install PySide6==5.15.2
